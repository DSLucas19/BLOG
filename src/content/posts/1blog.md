# The start of a journey

My name is Huy, and I want to be success.

English is my second language, and as much as I wanted to impress future recuiter with this fancy blog, to be honest, I'm not quite sure what I should do. I'm afraid that my grammar would be too horrible to be comprhensible, I'm afraid that I spell even the most basic word wrong. You can tell I'm scared of everything just by starting this blog. But here goes nothing.

Sorry for starting thing blog with a settling tone, It's just my first time trying to do something like this, I'm not even sure what will I write in this blog in the future. But like how I always said to myself "_The hardest part is always the first part_", I am hoping to achieve sort of comfort after I finish this first blog.

# Before 2025

I was your average student, studying and living in a quiet neighborhood in Vietnam.

I was determined, I want to be something different, to show the world my value. But I'm lack of a guider. A teacher who could teach me what I should do and not do. I am ordinary. And the feeling that I will be ordinary like my fellow and the people around gives me a chill down my spine. **I couldn't live like this, never**. Not that I hated this kind of living, it is just that I want to enjoy life more, and the way I am seeing people enjoying life is not my kind.

At secondary and even at highschool, I still haven't got a thought about deciding what my future me should become. I learn a little bit of Pascal, sufficient so that I can compete in a competition in my district. I do have a love for coding and gaming, and I indeed have spend time juggling and tweaking things out in Unity. But there were nothing more than that. Just like small phases of my life where I embarked on and then go back to the trail like everyone else is doing.

I talk to myself at night, at such a young age: "__Is this how I will live the rest of my life?__". And for everytime, I always said no.

# 2025

So that is what I'm going to do. Stepping in to college is such a huge milestone for me. I reachout to more people, expand my networking, do everything I can in order to gain as much knowledge as possible. I am thirst for knowledge. I want to become better. And without knowledge, I don't know what else I could try. So I take my best bet and attending at the University of Engineering and Technology in Vietnam. I self-taught how to write code, learn how to do finnace, learn how to do machine learning, exploratory data analysis, all of that jargons that always appear in the experts' conversation, I try my best to learn all of them. 

I never wanted to give up, I wanted to become something better. And I will try every ways, every things, no matter the stakes. I want everyone to know my burning passion. I want to become a data scientist.

# Beyond 2025

I don't know what is awaiting my in the daunting future. But I know that I will never back down, it's too late to back down. I will keep pushing foward. I will learn data science, learn how to do ML, learn how to deploy AI model. 

I want to get into FAANG, I want to live a comfy life.

I may sound like a kid. But I am **really** determined to do just that.

> Watch me.
